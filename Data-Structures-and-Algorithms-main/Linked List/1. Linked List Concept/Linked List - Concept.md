# Linked List - Concept

A linked list is a linear data structure in which each element is a separate object, and elements are connected to each other, similar to an array.

As you can see in the image, we maintain the Head pointer of the linked list and each node contains two fields:

Value (Integer)
Pointer to next node
The last node of a linked list is called Tail. The Tail's next pointer is NULL address indicating there is no element after it.

Primary Operations
Insertion: Inserting an element at end/beginning or in the middle at some kth position.
Deletion : Deleting an element from the list.
Display : Traversing the whole linked list and output each element.
